    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small>  We propose a Synthetic Instrumental Variables (SIV) estimator for panel data
that combines the strengths of instrumental variables and synthetic controls to
address unmeasured confounding. We derive conditions under which SIV is consistent and asymptotically normal, even when the standard IV estimator is not.
Motivated by the finite sample properties of our estimator, we introduce an ensemble estimator that simultaneously addresses multiple sources of bias and provide a permutation-based inference procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our methods through a calibrated simulation exercise, two shift-share empirical
applications, and an application in digital economics that includes both observational data and data from a randomized control trial. In our primary empirical
application, we examine the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on Turkish labor
markets. Here, the SIV estimator reveals significant effects that the standard
IV does not capture. Similarly, in our digital economics application, the SIV
estimator successfully recovers the experimental estimates, whereas the standard
IV does not.</small>

    <small>  Synthetic control methods often rely on matching pre-treatment characteristics (called predictors) of the treated unit. The choice of predictors and how they are weighted plays a key role in the performance and interpretability of synthetic control estimators. This paper proposes the use of a sparse synthetic control procedure that penalizes the number of predictors used in generating the counterfactual to select the most important predictors. We derive, in a linear factor model framework, a new model selection consistency result and show that the penalized procedure has a faster mean squared error convergence rate. Through a simulation study, we then show that the sparse synthetic control achieves lower bias and has better post-treatment performance than the un-penalized synthetic control. Finally, we apply the method to revisit the study of the passage of Proposition 99 in California in an augmented setting with a large number of predictors available.</small>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small>    The synthetic control method has become a widely popular tool to estimate causal effects with observational data. Despite this, inference for synthetic control methods remains challenging. Often, inferential results rely on linear factor model data generating processes. In this paper, we characterize the conditions on the factor model primitives (the factor loadings) for which the statistical risk minimizers are synthetic controls (in the simplex). Then, we propose a Bayesian alternative to the synthetic control method that preserves the main features of the standard method and provides a new way of doing valid inference. We explore a Bernstein-von Mises style result to link our Bayesian inference to the frequentist inference. For linear factor model frameworks we show that a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the synthetic control weights can consistently estimate the predictive function of the potential outcomes for the treated unit and that our Bayes estimator is asymptotically close to the MLE in the total variation sense. Through simulations, we show that there is convergence between the Bayes and frequentist approach even in sparse settings. Finally, we apply the method to re-visit the study of the economic costs of the German re-unification and the Catalan secession movement. The Bayesian synthetic control method is available in the bsynth R-package.</small>

      <i>Bagged Polynomial Regression and Neural Networks</i>, with <a href="https://klosins.github.io/">Sylvia Klosin</a> <br />
      <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small>  Series and polynomial regression are able to approximate the same function classes as neural networks. However, these methods are rarely used in practice, although they offer more interpretability than neural networks. In this paper, we show that a potential reason for this is the slow convergence rate of polynomial regression estimators and propose the use of bagged polynomial regression (BPR) as an attractive alternative to neural networks. Theoretically, we derive new finite sample and asymptotic L2 convergence rates for series estimators. We show that the rates can be improved in smooth settings by splitting the feature space and generating polynomial features separately for each partition. Empirically, we show that our proposed estimator, the BPR, can perform as well as more complex models with more parameters. Our estimator also performs close to state-of-the-art prediction methods in the benchmark MNIST handwritten digit dataset.</small>

      <i>The Effects of Regulating Food Delivery Platform Design</i>, with <a href="https://www.sabalalejandro.com/">Alejandro Sabal</a> <br />
      Draft available upon request.
      <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small> There is rising interest amongst regulators in understanding how different platform design choices affect welfare. In this project we focus on two important mechanisms platforms have at their disposal: (1) offering preferential treatment to producers in consumer search and (2) determining producer payments (commission fees). We study the welfare implications of different platform choices in the empirical setting of a food delivery platform that bargains with producers to set commission fees and to adjudicate fixed ranking slots in the consumer search wall. Using transaction level data and click stream search data from a large food delivery platform, we show that both mechanisms are important in practice. Producers with low commission fees are preferred by consumers, and low commission fees are used to attract valuable “anchor” producers that drive consumers into the platform. Search preferencing is also important. Using an A/B test in which rank was randomized we show that search rank is a driver of consumption. To evaluate the impact of different platform designs on consumer and restaurant welfare, we develop a structural model featuring a consumer demand with search frictions, bargaining between restaurants and the platform over ranks and commission fees, and restaurant and consumer entry into the platform. Using the model, we compute counterfactual experiments to assess the impact of regulations forbidding platforms from providing preferential rank to larger restaurants and from setting differential commission fees across restaurants.</small>

      <i>Recommendation Systems and Product Diversity in Online Platforms</i>, with Chinmay Lohani <br />
      <details>
    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small> Recommendation systems play a key role in shaping consumer welfare and market concentration on digital platforms. Better recommendations lead to better matches and lower search costs for consumers, but can also increase the market power of producers and the ability of the platform to extract surplus. In this paper, we consider a related, and less studied, consequence of improving recommendation systems: the effect on product variety. We develop a simple model of a two-sided platform with consumer and producer matches mediated by a recommendation system of varying quality. We show that as the quality of the recommendation system improves it becomes optimal, in equilibrium, for producers to offer products close to the average consumer. As a consequence, product diversity decreases, market concentration increases and consumer welfare becomes more unequal, with central consumers better off, but tail consumers worse off. Using the universe of  songs from a large music content platform, we provide evidence for the main prediction of the model; with the improvement of recommendations, we see a decrease in music content diversity and a strong correlation between popularity and centrality in the content space. </small>

    In 2022-2023 I was a statistics consultant for the Catalan office of public policy evaluation (<a href="https://ivalua.cat/en">Ivalua</a>) and the Catalan government on the design of a Universal Basic Income pilot program. My work involved designing a representative village level experiment using a small number of treatment units and providing a framework to perform valid statistical inference. As part of the work I extended existing methods in the application of synthetic controls to experimental design (see policy reports).

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <small> This paper provides a guide for practitioners wanting to use synthetic experimental designs to evaluate policy interventions. It focuses on the Catalan universal basic income pilot study that aims to treat two towns in 2023 with a substantial universal basic income for a period of two years. The main goal of the paper is to show how inference on various outcomes of interest can be achieved by choosing the towns to treat using the synthetic experimental design framework of Abadie and Zhao (2021). We show that approximate inference can be achieved despite the small number of treated units. This paper expands beyond the standard synthetic experimental design framework by considering inference on multiple outcomes and by providing a point-by-point rubric to dealing with practical concerns such as choosing exclusion constraints or thinking about allocation fairness.</small>
